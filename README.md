# Integer-to-English
 A program that converts integers in range of 1-999 into its English word (in lower case).

 # How it Works
 The program prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 999. If the input is within the 
 range, the program outputs the English spelling of the corresponding number. Entering the 
 Integer zero will terminate the program.
